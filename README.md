# Quick intro
Chip 8 is an interpreted programming language made in 1970 used for CPUs such as COSMAC VIP. A Chip-8 emulator is used to program in this language with ease, with a rather large amount of videogames made for it
such as Pong, Pac-man and others.

# How does it work
Download the project, open it with your respective IDE (this was programmed in Eclipse), and change the respective ROM string to whichever you want. Upload the ROMs in the ROM folder.
